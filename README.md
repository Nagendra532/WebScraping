# WebScraping
Here, I have Extracted the customer names and their reviews of products in amazon website  and displayed the data in the csv file in a table. I used  BeautifulSoup module to convert data to html format and requests module to get request from server and pandas module to save data in data frame. I extracted the names and reviews by using class names and performed some list functions.
